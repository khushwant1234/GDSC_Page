Use TailwindCSS (or any other CSS you prefer, even plain CSS) to enhance the design, improve the layout, and give it your personal touch. Your goal is to make this page look polished and user-friendly. You can inspect this page and use the source code as your base."

Some recommendations are Vercel, Netlify and Heroku. If your link is not up 24/7, that's not a problem. We just want to see how you deploy your project."

Focus on doing your best within the time you have, and finish however much of this task you can! Even if you don’t finish the project, submit what you’ve got—we just wanna see how you approach problems. We’re evaluating your programming skills, thought process, and even how you research and learn along the way."

Your Approach: Did you clearly explain your approach in the README?"
